# Simon Says Game
  This repository contains my mini project, a web-based Simon Game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Simon Game is a memory skill game where players must repeat increasingly long sequences of button presses generated by the     game.

# Features
  Interactive Gameplay: Players press buttons in the correct order as displayed by the game.
  Dynamic Levels: The game increases in difficulty with each level, presenting longer sequences to remember.
  Visual Feedback: Buttons flash to indicate sequences and provide feedback for user interactions.
  Responsive Design: The game is styled for a seamless experience across different devices.

# Technologies Used
  HTML: For structuring the webpage.
  CSS: For styling the buttons, text, and overall layout.
  JavaScript: For game logic, including sequence generation, user input handling, and level progression.

# How to Play
  Press any key to start the game.
  Watch the sequence of button flashes.
  Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order.
  Advance to the next level by correctly repeating the sequence.
  The game ends if an incorrect button is pressed, displaying the final score.
